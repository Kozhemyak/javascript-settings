# TeamCity Configuration for JS Project
## Introduction
------------------
This **README** file is used for syntax test. Moreover, it helps to find out the way to *How to struct it right*.

It's ~~stange way~~ __very convinient__ to write the recommendations.

But we want to make a relieble app. And the best way to do it is as someone said: 

>Write nothing, Deploy nowhere!

Use the backtick to refer to a `function()`.

By the way there is some code:
```powershell

get-service -name TCBuildAgent
```

Or some Kotlin:

```Kotlin
object Project : Project({
  uuid = "JavaScriptProject"
  id = "JavaScriptProject"
  parentId = "_Root"
  name = "JavaScript Project (Experimental)"
}
```
